// 1) Create an object that contains the names of 3 friends as keys, with each key pointing to that friend's age. (It is ok to guess your friends' ages.) Assign this object to a variable called friends.

// 2) Add a fourth friend to the friends object.

// 3) Access the age of your oldest friend. Save it to a variable, and print it

// 4) Loop through your friends object, and for each key-value pair, print "<name> is <age> years old"
